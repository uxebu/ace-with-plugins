ACE with plugins
================

ACE editor with additional plugins. The first plugin built is a renaming capability,
which is based on esprima, so the renaming takes place on all variables that are in
the correct scope. For use see [tddbin-frontend](https://github.com/uxebu/tddbin-frontend)
which might be the only place where this module is used.
